## Overview

This project implements a neural network from scratch in Java to translate Morse code into text. By avoiding external
machine learning libraries, this implementation makes the internal workings of neural networks transparent and
accessible for educational purposes.

### Key Features

- Pure Java implementation with no external dependencies
- Configurable network architecture
- Multiple activation functions and initialization strategies
- Learning rate decay options
- Model persistence capabilities
- Comprehensive Morse code support (A-Z, 0-9, space)
